# Prompt 1: Install the Ralph Loop Plugin and Frontend Design Skill

## What We're Installing

Two tools that work together:

* **Ralph Loop** — a plugin that runs structured improvement cycles on your app
* **Frontend Design** — a skill that gives Claude the eye of a professional UI designer

Together, Ralph will review and improve your app while the design skill makes sure it looks like it was built by a real company — not a weekend hack.

## Install Both

Run these in your terminal (not inside Claude Code — exit first or use a separate terminal):

```bash
claude claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code
claude plugin install ralph-wiggum
npx skills add https://github.com/anthropics/skills --skill frontend-design
```


Then go back into Claude Code:

```bash
cd \\\~/Desktop/my\\\_calorie\\\_tracker
claude
```

You're ready for the next prompt.
